## Overview of Classes

### `Problems.cls`

#### **Purpose**
This class is responsible for managing the main ticketing workflow. It includes:
- **Ticket Age Calculation**: Calculates the age of tickets in weeks based on their creation date.
- **Dynamic Forms**: Loads a form for filling ticket details if the status is set to anything other than "Completed" or "Cancelled."
- **Status Dropdown**: Uses a dropdown for ticket statuses like "In Progress," "Completed," and "Cancelled."

#### **How It Works**
- Automatically calculates ticket age when the issue start date is updated.
- Opens the ticket details form dynamically when required.
- Ensures invalid dates do not affect the calculations.
